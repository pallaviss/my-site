I am a Biomedical Engineer with special focus on design and development of cost effective solutions in healthcare service. I have completed my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering. I am currently a student of Biomedical Instrumentation under the guidance of Dr. Kalyani Bhole from Instrumentation and Control Dept. of College of Engineering, Pune. I am working on my dissertation titled "Alignment of X-ray Tube and Digital Detector using UWB and IMU sensor". This is an industrial project in alliance with Philips Heathcare Innovation Centre, Pune wherein I am working as a research Intern. My scope of interest varies from Biomedical Signal Processing to Medical Image processing and application of data analytics tool like machine learning/ deep learning to extract and analyse useful details from them. I am equally interested in deployment of cost effective heathcare solutions in the market.My technical skills can be summarized as acquiantance with embedded processors like Raspberry Pi, controller like arduino and computing languages like Python, embedded C , HTML along with softwares like Matlab/ Simulink.
I have always focussed on working on projects which are of socio-economic benifits such that it will aid the people who cant afford highly priced medical services. I see myself as a highly motivated researcher and strive hard to " get things together" in order to deliver a good product. My industrial exoerience of working as Regulatory affairs Executive and knowledge of ISO 13485 aids me while determining what medical norms should be considered while designing a medical product.I would summarize myself as a person who believes in carefully designing a plan of action and strictly adhering to it to achieve small but steady results. Overall my good hold of Biomedical knowledge and strong academics aid me in understanding any new topic and conceptualizing it into a good research project.
